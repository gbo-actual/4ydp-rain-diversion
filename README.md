#4ydp-rain-diversion

Capstone project for the University of Waterloo, Mechanical Engineering Class of 2015.
Team members: Christina Shum, Jonathan Leung, Fatima Shabbeer, Jonathan Gilmer, and Gabriel Ongpauco.

Our project was an automatic rain diversion system that was retrofittable to lampposts and bus stops. It consisted of a retractable canopy that was actuated via a custom-designed pulley mechanism driven by a motor.

This is the Arduino control code written by me to run the system autonomously or switch anytime to full manual control, with overrides for simulating various input signals.
